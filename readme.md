Week
====

Week shows a calendar of events for the current week.

[Events are taken from google calendars], and local remind calendars. It
supports the realisation that I don't need to sync my various calendars, just
provide a unified view of them.

I don't want to have to think about where I am capturing an appointment. On my
phone/ from google emails I can capture to google calendar. Locally from the
console I can note it down more conveniently in remind.

Since remind calendars are synced to my server, which can also access my
google calendars, I can get a week view locally in the command line or a web view
on my phone.

Week will aggregate as many calendars as are configured, but is read-only.

Still need a solution for recurring tasks (that disappear and reschedule only
once done), and notifications/alerts.
